## What are "Data Types"?
In Python (and computer programming in general), you can think of a data type as a label for a certain kind of value.
For example:
`42 is a number, Data is a word, B is a letter`
Number, word and letter are used to classify each value in this sentence, this isn't programming, it's just plain English.
If i asked you to think of a number, you probably wouldn't be thinking of 'B' or 'Z', this is because we have learnt to tell different kinds of values apart. Now we will be learning the same thing but not in the English language but in the Python programming language.
## Basic Data Types
The Python programming language comes with a few built-in data types, but for this article we will focus on four of them, which are:
* Integer - `int`
* Floating point - `float`
* String - `str`
* Boolean - `bool`
They probably don't seem as obvious as number, word and letter that we discussed earlier, but you'll get used to it quickly, I promise ;)
### Integer
If you are already familiar with the concept of Integers in Basic Mathematics, then you're good, it basically means the same thing here. All positive and negative whole numbers belong to this category of values called Integers.
Look at these examples
```
42 is an Integer
593 is an Integer
-69 is an Integer
B is not an Integer
"data" is not an Integer
9.8 is not an Integer
-0.1 is not an Integer
```
